[John Doerr][0] originally presented OKRs to Google's leadership in 1999 when Google was less than a year old, and they've been in use ever since. OKRs are about the company's goals and how each employee contributes to those goals.

Here are a few keys to what make OKRs work 

* Objectives are **ambitious**, and should feel somewhat uncomfortable
* Key Results are **measurable**; they should be easy to grade with a number (for example a 0--1.0 scale to grade each key result at the end of a quarter)
* OKRs are **public;** everyone in the company should be able to see what everyone else is working on (and how they did in the past)
* The**"sweet spot" for an OKR grade is .6 --- .7**; if someone consistently gets 1.0, their OKRs aren't ambitious enough.
* **Low grades shouldn't be punished**; see them as data to help refine the next quarter's OKRs.
* **OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations**. Performance evaluations --- which are entirely about evaluating how an employee performed in a given period --- should be independent from their OKRs.
